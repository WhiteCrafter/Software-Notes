# State Handling
State Handling patterns manipulate the state of objects generically. This means that these patterns work on the state of any object or class, independent of the actual purpose of these objects/classes.
## [[Memento]]
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an objects´s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.  
**A.K.A**: Token
## [[Prototype]]
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance and create new objects by copying this prototype.
## [[Singleton]]
Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
## [[Flyweight]]
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
