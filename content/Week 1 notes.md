# Introduction
- Examples of programs: 
	- source code - 
	- object code - 
	- intermediate code - 
		- libraries, frameworks -  libraries are collection of code, frameworsk can be expanded
	- installation programs - installs programs
	- test programs - searches for bugs
- Examples of associated data: initialization data, examples, user manuals, help information, error messages, architectural description, program documentation, test data, expected test output.


# Planning Phase
-  The main output of  the planning phase is  a [[requirements document]] that describes the system to be developed in **words of the user(s)**
- The process of determining the requirements  is called [[requirements elicitation]]
- A **feasibility study** determines whether the software development organization is capable of implementing the requirements (capability and capacity)
- **Cost estimation** is necessary to make sure the software can be delivered at a
competitive price; the project plan determines the development time and personnel
required.
### What is a Requirement
- The IEEE Standard 610.12-1990 defines **requirement** as follows:
  >*"A **condition or capability** that must be met or possessed by a system or system component **to satisfy** a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document. The set of all requirements forms the basis for subsequent development of the system or system component".*

## Planning Phase -- first steps
- The planning phase begins with the selection of a product or project
	- Customer request
	- Request for competitive bids, for example by the government
	- Research results
	- Predevelopment
	- Trend studies
	- Market analysis
	- An idea! (for a startup or an extension of a product portfolio)

## Requirements elicitation
- Determines the main requirements of the product
- Various techniques available:
	- Introspection (think about it yourself!)
	- Questionnaires
	- Interviews with potential users
	- Brainstorming (in groups)
	- Task analysis (studying the work being done)
	- Document analysis (analyzing the documents used in a workflow)
	- Scenarios (a concrete event or sequence of events or actions)
	- Use cases (use case diagrams for that)
